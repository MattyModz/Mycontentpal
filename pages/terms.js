          So - you’re either thinking about or have bought content with us -
          thank you! Now, here’s for the boring bit - the Terms and Conditions.
          We know you’re most likely to skip reading them (like 90% of people)
          but we’ve condensed them down as much as we can and we think it’s
          really important that you read through our terms so you know exactly
          what to expect. Got a question about a T and C? Drop us an email over
          at support@mycontentpal.com. Content Orders What your content order
          includes: ➔ Frequent communication with a Content Manager ➔ Each
          article run through Surfer SEO ➔ Back end Surfer preparation ➔ Content
          writing ➔ Proofreading ➔ Checking through Grammarly and Copyscape What
          your content order doesn’t include: ➔ Content ideation ➔ Keyword
          research (including the use of Text Razor or Ahrefs) ➔ A guaranteed
          content score ➔ Link research ➔ Any form of Media/Multi-media
          including, but not limited to Pictures or Images, Screenshots, Screen
          Captures, Videos, Gifs, or any links to forms of media (including, but
          not limited to the aforementioned) ➔ Any form of Graphs ➔ Product
          Research (You would have to provide us with a list of products) We can
          include some of the above, but it’ll cost extra. Please get in touch
          with us if you require any of the above. Order types and turnaround
          times Our minimum word order is 1,000 words. We don’t have a maximum
          order, but if you’re looking to brief anything more than 100,000,
          please get in contact to discuss turnaround times. For more
          information on orders, please see our pricing page. We don’t have a
          one-size-fits-all turnaround time for content. Why is that? Well, it’s
          because certain types of content might take longer to complete.
          Generally, a batch of 50,000 words will take no longer than 3 weeks to
          complete. For a better idea of what sort of turnaround time we can
          offer for your content, please get in touch providing details on your
          briefs. The type of content we offer Below is a list of the type of
          content we can offer. If what you’re after is not on this list, please
          let us know and we’ll see what we can do. ➔ Blog ➔ How-To ➔ Listicle ➔

          Quality guarantee Here at My Content Pal, we aim to deliver you
          content that we would be proud to display on our own website. This is
          why we have the following guarantees: ➔ Adhering to the brief provided
          by the client and accepted by the content manager ➔ Passing Copyscape
          ➔ Grammarly score of 90+% ➔ Surfer optimised ➔ Proofed by our team of
          editors Although we endeavour to give content to writers that have
          experience in this niche, this is not always possible. For the most
          part, our writers are not field experts and will be conducting
          research via the internet. Our editors will perform basic
          fact-checking during the proofing process for things such as health
          claims. However, none of our editors are field experts and so we
          cannot guarantee that everything written will be factually correct to
          an expert level of knowledge. Revision requests Here at My Content
          Pal, we endeavour to make our customers happy and therefore, offer one
          reasonable revision request per piece of content. You must request a
          revision within 10 working days of completion of the piece of content
          via your content manager. If accepted, we will then complete your
          request within 10 working days. However, we will not revise anything
          that wasn’t requested in the brief. This includes stylistic
          alterations, such as changing the tone of voice or adding in more
          links. In the event that a product you supplied us with is out of
          stock or has a price change upon delivering the article, we are not
          responsible for finding a product replacement or updating the price.
          If you also request a revision to the brief after we have accepted it,
          we cannot guarantee that it will be put into place. Content revision
          requests that increase the original word count will not be allowed.
          Any and all revisions should stay within the article word count as
          stipulated in the content brief. Content refusal We love a challenge
          at My Content Pal and are up for tackling the nichest of niches.
          However, we do reserve the right to refuse any content briefed to us
          after the purchase of credits. The type of content we will definitely
          refuse includes anything that promotes harm, illegal activity or is
          factually inaccurate. Content Briefs After you sign up, you will be
          sent a Shared Sheet that you would have to put your content briefs
          into. All the fields in the Shared Sheet that indicates a star (*) in
          them, are mandatory and you will need to fill in this field (provided
          it applies to the type of content briefs you added). You would need to
          mark the content as “Ready for MCP” in order for your content manager
          to forward your content to the team. The 3-week TAT (Turn around time)
          countdown will start as soon as your Content Manager has marked the
          content as “Received”. The Team Content manager Upon completion of
          credit purchase, you will be assigned a content manager who will be
          your point of contact throughout the content creation journey. They
          will introduce themselves and create a Google shared sheet for you to
          input your briefs. You will also be entitled to one 30-minute phone
          call with your content manager to discuss your content creation.
          Please be aware that communication with your assigned manager is not a
          24/7 service, and if you have a query or question, we will get back to
          you within 2 working days. The writers All writers chosen to complete
          your content will be picked by the content manager. Unfortunately, you
          cannot pick the writer/s and their identity will remain anonymous. The
          editors As mentioned above, all content is put through our proofing
          process before it reaches you. You might see the editors pop up on
          your shared sheet when filling in the completed content but you won’t
          have contact with them. Other Content ownership After we have created
          and delivered your order, the content is 100% owned by you. Neither we
          nor the writer has any copyright ownership of it. It might be the case
          that we are really proud of the content we have produced for you and
          ask to use it as case studies for what we can do. We will always ask
          for your permission before this is done and you are within your right
          to decline. Content credits expiration Your content credits that you
          have purchased with us will never expire and you can redeem/use them
          at any point in time. Non-refundable Unfortunately, once you have
          bought credits with us, these are non-refundable. If you want to
          cancel an order once we have accepted a brief, you will not be
          entitled to a refund of credits. Feedback Here at My Content Pal, we
          always strive to do better. Therefore, we value your feedback, whether
          it is good, bad or ugly. After your content is delivered, your content
          manager will send you a feedback form we would love you to complete.
          Alternatively, you can leave us a review on Trustpilot.
